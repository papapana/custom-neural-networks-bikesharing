# Prediction of bikesharing patterns using custom Neural Networks

## Description

This repository is based on the Udacity project to predict bike-sharing ridership. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how to solve the problem with neural networks without using any neural network framework.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The project itself is implemented in a Jupyter notebook in the file `Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb`
